1. Determine whether the following statements are true or false
   (Assume that total = 10 and num = 5)

    a. num >= 5 && total==20
      Answer: false, since total==20 is false.
      
    b. (num==0) || (total/num) >2
      Answer: false, since both conditions are false.
      
    c. num != total && total>1
      Answer: true, since both conditions evaluate to true.
      
    d. num==total || total >5 && total <15
      Just for clarity, I'm going to outline what happens here:
      1)num==total evaluates to false. Since the first condition is false,
        the computer can't take advantage of short-circuit evaluation and must
        check the next condition (total >5 && total <15).
      2)total >5 evaluates to true.
      3)total <15 evaluates to true.
      4)Since the two conditions are true, total >5 && total<15 evaluates to
        true.
      5)Since total >5 && total<15 is true, num==total || total >5 && total <15
        is also true.
      Answer: true.
      
2. Write a statement that prints out “Hot” if x is greater than or equal to
   70, and “Cold” if x is less than or equal to 40. If x is between the two,
   it should print “Not too bad”, and if x is negative, it should also print
   “Way too cold”.

    Answer:
    
    if(x >= 70){
        System.out.println("Hot");
    } else if(x >= 40){
        System.out.println("Not too bad");
    } else{
        System.out.println("Cold");
        if(x < 0){
            System.out.println("Way too cold");
        }
    }
   
   Note: There are other ways to do this correctly, but this way is pretty
   concise and simplifies the computer's job by using logic to remove
   extraneous checking.
   
3. The current conversion rate between Dollar and the Euro is 1 Dollar = .76 
   Euros. Keeping this in mind, write a simple program that prompts the user
   for a dollar amount and displays that same amount of money in Euros.
